C
Give me a second I 

I need to get my story straight
     Am
My friends are in the bathroom

getting higher than the empire state
     F
my lover she's waiting for me

just across the bar
              Dm
My seats been taken by some sunglasses
G
asking 'bout a scar
    C 
and I know I gave it to you months ago
Am
 I know you're trying to forget
       F
but between the drinks and subtle things

the holes in my apologies
        Dm                         G 
you know I'm trying hard to take it back


Pre-chorus
              F          G
so if by the time the bar closes
         C       Em        Am
and you feel like falling down
       F       G
I'll carry you home 



Chorus

  C
Tonight
   Em   Am 
We are young
                          F
So let's set the world on fire

We can burn brighter 
         C  G
than the sun


Verse 2:

       C
Now I know that I'm not

all that you got
  Am
I guess that I
                                                     F
I just thought maybe we could find a ways to fall apart

But are friends in back

So let's raise a cup
Dm                         G
 Cause I found someone to carry me home 

Chorus [x2]

 C
Tonight
   Em   Am 
We are young
                          F
So let's set the world on fire

We can burn brighter 
         C  G
than the sun


 C                F
Carry me home tonight
     C                G 
Just carry me home tonight
C               F
Carry me home tonight
      C               G
Just carry me home tonight

(the following is sung during the part above)

[The world is on my side

I have no reason to run

So will someone come and carry me home tonight

The angels never arrived

but I can hear the choir

so will someone come and carry me home]


Chorus [2x]

C
Tonight
   Em   Am 
We are young
                          F
So let's set the world on fire

We can burn brighter 
         C  G
than the sun


Pre-chorus

 F          G
so if by the time the bar closes
         C       Em        Am
and you feel like falling down
       F       G
I'll carry you home
