D - A - F#m - E 

[Verse 1]

D          A         F#m    E
I was left to my own devices
D         A              F#m         E
Many days fell away with nothing to show


[Pre-Chorus]

D                           A
And the walls kept tumbling down
                   F#m   E
In the city that we loved
D                          A
Great clouds roll over the hills
                       F#m  E
Bringing darkness from Above


[Chorus]

                      D
But if you close your eyes,
        A
Does it almost feel like
F#m                 E
Nothing changed at all?
                      D
And if you close your eyes,
        A
Does it almost feel like
F#m                E       
You've been here before?
D                    A         E
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
D                    A          E
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?


[Verse 2]

D              A              F#m         E
We were caught up and lost in all of our vices
D            A           F#m             E
In your pose as the dust settles around us


[Pre-Chorus]

D                           A
And the walls kept tumbling down
                    F#m E
In the city that we loved
D                          A
Great clouds roll over the hills
                       F#m  E
Bringing darkness from Above


[Chorus]

                      D
But if you close your eyes,
        A
Does it almost feel like
F#m                 E
Nothing changed at all?
                      D
And if you close your eyes,
        A
Does it almost feel like
F#m                E       
You've been here before?


D                    A         E
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
D                    A         E
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

D A F#m  E


[Bridge]

D              A
Oh where do we begin?
F#m                E
The rubble or our sins?
D              A
Oh where do we begin?
F#m                E
The rubble or our sins?


[Pre-Chorus]

D                           A
And the walls kept tumbling down
                    F#m  E
In the city that we loved
D                          A
Great clouds roll over the hills
                       F#m  E
Bringing darkness from Above


[Chorus]

                     D
But if you close your eyes,
        A
Does it almost feel like
F#m                  E
Nothing changed at all?
                      D
And if you close your eyes,
        A
Does it almost feel like
F#m               E       
You've been here before?
D                    A          E
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
D                    A          E
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

                      D
But if you close your eyes,
        A
Does it almost feel like
F#m                  E
Nothing changed at all?
