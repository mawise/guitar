Well you [G]dawned on me and you bet I felt it,
I [D]tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted,
I [Em]fell right through the cracks,
And now I'm [C] tryin to get back....

Before the [G]cool dun run out, Ill be givin it my bestest
[D]Nothin's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I [Em]reckon its again my turn,
To [C]Win some or learn some....

But [G]I wont hesi[D]tate
No more, No [Em]more
It can not [C]wait; I'm Yours [G] [D] [Em] [C] 

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love

Listen to the music of the moment people, dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved love love

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm sure
There's no need to complicate, our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

D-d-do do you, but do you, d-d-do
But do you want to come on
Scooch on over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do, our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours
Open up your mind and see like me
(I won't hesitate)
Open up your plans and damn you're free
(No more, no more)
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
(It cannot wait, I'm sure)

So please don't please don't, there's no need
(There's no need to complicate)
There's no need to complicate
(Our time is short)
Our time is short
(This is our fate)
This is, this is, this is our fate
I'm yours

Oh, I'm yours
Oh, I'm yours
Oh, whoa, baby you believe I'm yours
You best believe, best believe I'm yours
