G                       D  
My head is stuck in the clouds
G                   D 
She begs me to come down
      Em         D       C
Says, "Boy, quit foolin' around"
             G                       D
I told her, "I love the view from up here
G                       D
Warm sun and wind in my ear
      Em        D          C
We'll watch the world from above
      D                      G
As it turns to the rhythm of love"

       C         G
We may only have tonight
             C                   G
But till the morning sun, you're mine
B7  Em
All mine
         D     C
Play the music low
    D                     G      D  G    D
And sway to the rhythm of love

G                     D
My heart beats like a drum
G                      D
A guitar string to the strum
  Em        D          C
A beautiful song to be sung
          G                       D
She's got blue eyes deep like the sea
     G                                D
That roll back when she's laughing at me
    Em    D           C
She rises up like the tide
    D                   G
The moment her lips meet mine

       C         G
We may only have tonight
             C                   G
But till the morning sun, you're mine
B7  Em
All mine
         D     C
Play the music low
    D                     G     D  G    D
And sway to the rhythm of love
B7       C       G    D
When the moon is low
B7     C        G    D        C
We can dance in slow motion
    C        D             C
And all your tears will subside
         D          G     D  G    D
All your tears will dry

    G               D
And long after I've gone
G                        D
You'll still be humming along
    Em          D         C
And I will keep you in my mind
    D                    G
The way you make love so fine
       C         G
We may only have tonight
             C                   G
But till the morning sun, you're mine
B7  Em
All mine
         D     C
Play the music low
    D                     G     D  G    D
And sway to the rhythm of love
Em       D     C
Play the music low
    D                     G     D  G 
And sway to the rhythm of love
      D                     G   D  G
Yeah, sway to the rhythm of love
