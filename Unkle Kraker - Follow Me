You don't know how you met me, You don't know why
You can't turn around and say goodbye
        F                            A# 
All you know is when I'm with you, I make you free
    F                              A#   C  F
And swim through your veins like a fish in the sea
I'm singin'

[CHORUS]
Follow me everything is alright
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
And if you
Want to leave I can guarantee
You won't find nobody else like me

I'm not worried 'bout the ring you wear
Cuz as long as no one knows than nobody can care
You're feelin' guilty and I'm well aware
But you don't look ashamed and baby I'm not scared
I'm singin'

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Won't give you money
I can't give you the sky
You're better off if you don't ask why
I'm not the reason that you go astray and
We'll be all right if you don't ask me to stay

[REPEAT CHORUS]

You don't know how you met me
You don't know why
You can't turn around and say goodbye
All you know is when I'm with you
I make you free
And swim through your veins like a fish in the sea
I'm singin'

[REPEAT CHORUS]
