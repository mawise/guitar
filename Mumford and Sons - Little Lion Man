Capo at 5

This tab is by ear and one of my firsts.  Marcus appears to play w/ capo on 5 in live 
and their official video.  He may use different fingerings for the chords however).  GL!


Intro:   (Listen for rhythm and strumming pattern)

Am      C       x4

(To emulate banjo play   Am    Am-add6     Am    C    the last two times)

Verse 1:
Am
Weep for yourself, my man,
                               C
you'll never be what is in your heart.
Am
Weep little lion man,
                                       C
you're not as brave as you were at the start.
G
Rate yourself and rape yourself,
F            Fmaj7            C
take all the courage you have left.
G
Wasted on fixing all the
F                Fmaj7             C
problems that you made in your own head.

Chorus: (Sustain C chord)

         Am          F          C
But it was not your fault but mine,
         Am         F         C
and it was your heart on the line.
         Am        F        C
I really fucked it up this time,
             G
didn't I, my dear?
                  Am
Didn't I, my dear?

Am    C     x2


Verse 2:
Am
Tremble for yourself my man,
                                       C
you know that you have seen this all before.
Am
Tremble little lion man,
                                C
you'll never settle any of your scores.
G
Your grace is wasted in your face,
     F               Fmaj7            C
your boldness stands alone among the wreck.
G
Learn from your mother or else
F               Fmaj7            C
spend your days biting your own neck.


Chorus:
         Am          F          C
But it was not your fault but mine,
         Am         F         C
and it was your heart on the line.

I really fucked it up this time,
             G
didn't I, my dear?

But it was not your fault but mine,

and it was your heart on the line.
