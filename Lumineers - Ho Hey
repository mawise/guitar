INTRO

    C ... F â†’ C (x4, alternating "Ho!" and "Hey!" on the final C)

VERSE

    C                               F   C 
    I've been trying to do it right
    C                               F   C 
    I've been living a lonely life
    C                               F   C 
    I've been sleeping here instead
    C                               F   Am 
    I've been sleeping in my bed
    Am                G    C
    ...Sleeping in my bed
    
    So show me family
    All the blood that I would bleed
    I don't know where I belong
    I don't know where I went wrong
    Am                   G     C 
    ...But I can write a song

CHORUS

                        Am                   G 
          I belong with you, you belong with me
                          C 
          You're my sweet... heart
                        Am                   G 
          I belong with you, you belong with me
                              C 
          You're my sweet... (Ho!)
          
    (repeat intro chords)

    I don't think you're right for him
    Look at what it might have been, if you
    Took a bus to Chinatown
    I'd be standing on Canal
    Am         G   C 
    ...and Bowery
    Am                      G           C 
    ...and she was standing next to me

          I belong with you, you belong with me
          You're my sweet... heart
          I belong with you, you belong with me
          You're my sweet... heart

BRIDGE

              F                      G 
              Love -----------... we need it now
                    F                      G 
              Let's hope -----... hope for some
              F                         G 
              So -------------... we're bleeding out

    I belong with you, you belong with me
    You're my sweet... heart
    I belong with you, you belong with me
    You're my sweet... (Ho!)
          
    (repeat intro chords, end on a "hey!")
