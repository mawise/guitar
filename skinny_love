[Verse 1]

Am             F                   C

Come on skinny love, just last the year

Am             F                    C

Pour a little salt, we were never here

        Am        F                     C

My my my - my my my - my my my my - my my ...

               Dm                        Am

Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer

Am        F                C

I tell my love to wreck it all

Am              F                C

Cut out all the ropes and let me fall

        Am        F                    C

My my my - my my my - my my my my my

             Dm                 Am

Right in the moment this order's tall

 

[Chorus]

  C                         Em            Am

I told you to be patient, I told you to be fine

  C                          Em            Am

I told you to be balanced, I told you to be kind

         C

In the morning I'll be with you

            Em              Am

But it will be a different kind

          C

I'll be holding all the tickets

               Em            Am

And you'll be owning all the fines

 

[Verse 2]

Am            F                  C

Come on skinny love, what happened here

Am            F                  C

Suckle on the hope in lite brassiere

        Am        F                  C

My my my - my my my - my my my - my my ...

        Dm                          Am

Sullen load is full, so slow on the split

 

[Chorus]

   C                         Em           Am

I told you to be patient, I told you to be fine

   C                         Em            Am

I told you to be balanced, I told you to be kind

     C                            Em             Am

Now all your love is wasted, then who the hell was I?

                C

Cause now I'm breaking at the britches

           Em              Am

And at the end of all your lines

 

[Bridge]

C                  Em         Am

Who will love you? Who will fight?

C                  Em      Am

And who will fall, far behind?

Am             F           C

Come on skinny love ........

        Am        F                     C

My my my - my my my - my my my - my my ...

        Am        F                     C

My my my - my my my - my my my - my my ...
