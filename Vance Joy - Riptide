Am           G                   C (x2)

Am              G                C
I was scared of dentists and the dark,
Am              G                 C
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations,
Am        G                   C
Oh all my friends are turning green,
            Am         G                  C
You're the magicians assistant in their dreams.

Am   G   C
Ooh, ooh ooh
Am   G             C (hold)
Ooh, ooh, and they come unstuck

[Chorus:]
Am    G                    C
Lady, running down to the riptide,
C                 Am
taken away to the dark side,
G               C
I wanna be your left hand man.
  Am       G                        C
I love you when you're singing that song and,
C                  Am
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
G                           C
you're gonna sing the words wrong

Am                 G                   C
There's this movie that I think you'll like,
     Am             G                C
this guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City,
     Am        G              C
this cowboy's running from himself.
    Am                G              C
And she's been living on the highest shelf

Am   G   C
Ooh, ooh ooh
Am   G             C (hold)
Ooh, ooh, and they come unstuck

(Chorus)

Fingerpicking

Am                         G
I just wanna, I just wanna know,
C                                  F
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay,
Am                         G
I just gotta, I just gotta know,
C                                F (strum and hold)
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way

Strum once and hold:
  Am          G                   C
I swear she's destined for the screen,
Am                G                C
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh

(Chorus x3)
