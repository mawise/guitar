THE LONGEST TIME -Billy Joel
C    G   C   F    G7              C         G    C   F   G7            ... 
Oh,  oh  oh  oh   For the longest time.     oh   oh  oh.  For the longest....
C               F           C                            D7            G    
If you said goodbye to me tonight.   There would still be music left to write.
                                     c           b        a             g

E7             Am      G7         C      C7    
What else could I do?  I'm so inspired by you.

F            Dm               G       C    
That hasn't happened for the longest time.

C                  F             C                          D7             G  
Once I  thought my innocence was gone.      Now I know that happiness goes on.
E7               Am          G7                C     C7         
That's where you found me,   when you put your arms around me.  
F          Dm                 G       C
.I haven't been there for the longest time.
 
C   G   C   F   G7              C      G    C   F   G7                
Oh! oh  oh  oh  For the longest time.  Oh!  oh  oh. For the longest.. 
C                     F              C                         D7        
G   
I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall.    And the greatest miracle of all,
E7          Am        G7             C      C7     
.  is how I need you.   And how you  needed me too.
F           Dm               G       C     
That hasn't happened for the longest time. 
G                Am                   B7                     C            
   
Maybe this won't last very long,  but you feel so right, and I could be wrong.
Em              Am              
Maybe I've been hoping too hard,
.   D              D7           G           G7       
but I've gone this far and it's more than I hoped for
C                  F                C                  D7                G
   
Who knows how much further we'll go on.  Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone.
E7             Am       G7           C      C7        
. I'll take my chances, I forgot how nice romance is. 
F          Dm                 G       C     
.I haven't been there for the longest time. 
G            Am                        B7                  C              
 
I had second thoughts at the start.  I said to myself hold on to your heart.
.Em             Am                   
.Now I know the woman that you are.  
.      D            D7           G           G7        
You're wonderful so far and it's more than I hoped for.
C                 F              C                     D7               G 
   
I don't care what consequence it brings. I have been a fool for lesser things.
E7         Am          G7           C        C7        
.   I want you so bad,  I think you ought to know that 
F           Dm               G       C     
I intend to hold you for the longest time. 
C   G   C   F   G7              C      ||: G   C   F   G7               C  :||
Oh, oh, oh, oh. For the longest time.      Oh  oh  oh  For the longest.time.
