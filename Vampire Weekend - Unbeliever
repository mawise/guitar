Got a little soul
     F          C          F       C
The world is a cold, cold place to be
Want a little warmth
But who's going to save a little warmth for me

Em                F
We know the fire awaits unbelievers
Dm                     C
All of the sinners the same
Em                  F               Dm                         C
Girl you and I will die unbelievers bound to the tracks of the train

If I’m born again I know that the world will disagree
Want a little grace, but who’s going to say a little grace for me?

We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl you and I will die unbelievers bound to the tracks of the train

C                E F
I'm not excited
                 C  G
But should I be
             C                     F
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?

C                 E F
I know I love you
                     C G
And you love the sea
                C                      F
Wonder if the water contains a little drop little drop for me

See the sun go down
It's going on down when the night is deep
Want a little light but who's going to save a little light for me?

We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl you and I will die unbelievers bound to the tracks of the train

I'm not excited
But should I be
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?

I know I love you
And you love the sea
Wonder if the water contains a little drop little drop for me

I'm not excited
But should I be
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?

I know I love you
And you love the sea
Wonder if the water contains a little drop little drop for me
