Intro: A C#m D E (2x)

Note: The verse begins the second time E is played in the intro

(Verse Part 1)
E          A C#m D
If I had a hammer
E                 A C#m D
I'd hammer in the morning
E                 A C#m D
I'd hammer in the evening
E
all over this land,

(Verse Part 2)
E              A
I'd hammer out danger
                 Dmaj7**
I'd hammer out a warning
               D    A       D                  A          D
I'd hammer out love between my brothers and my sisters
E              A C#m D
All over this land.

** I play this as Dmaj7 but its not quite right. I'm not
   sure what this actual chord is, but you can play either
   Dmaj7 or D and it sounds fine.

(Verse Part 1)
If I had a bell
I'd ring it in the morning
I'd ring it in the evening
All over this land,

(Verse Part 2)
I'd ring out danger
I'd ring out a warning
I'd ring out love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land.

(Verse Part 1)
If I had a song
I'd sing it in the morning
I'd sing it in the evening
all over this world,

(Verse Part 2)
I'd sing out danger
I'd sing out a warning
I'd sing out love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land.

(Verse Part 1)
If I've got a hammer
And I've got a bell
And I've got a song to sing
all over this land,

(Verse Part 2)
It's a hammer of justice
It's a bell of freedom
It's a song about love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land.

(Last verse Repeated)
It's a hammer of justice
It's a bell of freedom
It's a song about love between my brothers and my sisters
E             A  D  A
All over this land.
