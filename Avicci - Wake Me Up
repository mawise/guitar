        Bm  G   D   A



Bm         G              D      D
Feeling my way through the darkness

Bm     G            D    D
Guided by a beating heart

Bm      G              D         D
I can’t tell where the journey will end

Bm    G             D     D
But I know where it starts

Bm           G                D       D
They tell me I’m too young to understand

Bm           G              D     D
They say I’m caught up in a dream

Bm             G               D          D
Well life will pass me by if I don’t open up my eyes

Bm          G       D   D
Well that’s fine by me





           Bm      G        D  A
So wake me up when it’s all over

         Bm    G       D  A
When I’m wiser and I’m older

         Bm         G       D  A
All this time I was finding myself

      Bm     G          D  A
And I didn’t know I was lost

           Bm      G        D  A
So wake me up when it’s all over

         Bm    G       D  A
When I’m wiser and I’m older

         Bm         G       D  A
All this time I was finding myself

      Bm     G          D  A
And I didn’t know I was lost
