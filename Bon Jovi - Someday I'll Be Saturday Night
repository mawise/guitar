Capo 1
[Intro]

D                     G
Hey man I'm alive I'm takin' each day a night at a time
D                                 A
Yeah I'm down but I know I'll get by
            G                   A
Hey hey hey hey man I've gotta live my life
       D                          Bm
Like I ain't got nothing but this roll of the dice
    A                         G                        D
I'm feelin' like a Monday but someday I'll be Saturday night


[Verse]

D
Hey my name is Jim where did I go wrong
   F#m
My life's a bargain basement all the good shit's gone
  G
I just can't hold a job, where do I belong
     A                     G      A     D
Been sleepin' in my car my dreams moved on

 D                          
My name is Billy Jean my love is bought and sold
 F#m
I'm only sixteen I feel a hundred years old
   G
My foster daddy went and took my innocence away
A                                    G                 A
Street life ain't much better but at least I'm getting paid


[Pre-Chorus]

Bm                 G
Tuesday just might go my way
D
Can't get worse than yesterday
F#m
Thursdays, Fridays ain't been kind
    G       A
But somehow I'll survive


[Chorus]

D                     G
Hey man I'm alive I'm takin' each day a night at a time
D                                 A
Yeah I'm down but I know I'll get by
            G                   A
Hey hey hey hey man I've gotta live my life
       D                          Bm
Like I ain't got nothing but this roll of the dice
    A                         G                        D
I'm feelin' like a Monday but someday I'll be Saturday night

[Verse]

 D                          
I can't see my name or tell you where I am
        F#m
I wanna blow myself away, don't know if I can
   G
I wish that I could be in another time and place
     A                    G              A
With someone else's soul, someone else's face


[Pre-Chorus]

Bm                 G
Tuesday just might go my way
D
Can't get worse than yesterday
F#m
Thursdays, Fridays ain't been kind
    G       A
But somehow I'll survive


[Chorus]

D                     G
Hey man I'm alive I'm takin' each day a night at a time
D                                 A

Hey hey hey hey man I'm gonna live my life
       D                          Bm
Like I ain't got nothing but this roll of the dice
