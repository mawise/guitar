[VERSE 1]
Am                 C
October's got those orange eyes
    G         F
But somehow I still lost sight
Am                  C             G
When you lifted the lid off of my pumpkin head 
    F
And kissed me goodnight
Am             C
Should it be a thorn in my side
   G           F
We never quite broke that horse
Am               C
She slept in the cul-de-sac right
G                F
Seven miles from my front porch

Am  C  G  F*
Am  C  G  G

[VERSE 2]
Am            C
Bundle up and come with me now
G                          F
Down the road where to the burnt down barn
Am              C
We could make a blanket of coats
    G                          F
And breathe our souls into the neighbourâ€™s front lawn
Am              C
But oh god that look in your eye
G                 F
Trouble that does not search words
Am                 C
It sprung from the biblical vine
        G            F
And are waiting to return to the dirt

Am  C  G  F*
Am  C  G  G

[CHORUS]
     Am              C
The stitches in your winter clothes
     G
Your cello bows
   F
We stole your hair to make them
       Am           C
We're sorry for the iron shoes
   G
We nailed to you
    F
And stuck you in the rain
         Am             C
And then you sprinted away
           G                  F
Sprinted away to where I don't know
Am                   C
God's moving in your bloodstream
          G                     F
Where the cross beats aren't so slow

Am  C  G  F*
Am  C  G  F*
Am  C  G  F*
Am  C  G  G

|VERSE 3|
Am                C
You swept all the red from my cheeks
  G               F
I didn't hear you come back inside
Am               C
And light up the gas in the den
    G                  F
And stand there in the thin winter light
Am              C
But oh god that curve in your spine
  G                  F
A question mark , A doctor sign 
Am                C
was framed by the windowsill
        G               F
And you saw something I did not end that night
Am              C
    G               F
You saw something I did not end that night

[CHORUS]
     Am              C
The stitches in your winter clothes
     G
Your cello bows
   F
We stole your hair to make them
       Am           C
We're sorry for the iron shoes
   G
We nailed to you
    F
And stuck you in the rain
         Am             C
And then you sprinted away
           G                  F
Sprinted away to where I don't know
Am                   C
God's moving in your bloodstream
          G                     F
Where the cross beats aren't so slow
Am                   C
God's moving in your bloodstream
          G                     F
Where the cross beats aren't so slow
Am                   C
God's moving in your bloodstream
          G                     F
Where the cross beats aren't so slow
Am                   C
God's moving in your bloodstream
          G                     F
Where the cross beats aren't so slow
Am                   C
God's moving in your bloodstream
          G                     F
Where the cross beats aren't so slow
