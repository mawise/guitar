BEHIND BLUE EYES
The Who
 
Em                     G               D
No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man,
          C          A
To be the sad man, behind blue eyes
Em                     G          D
No one knows what it's like to be hated,
      C                 A
To be fated, to telling only lies
 
CHORUS
       C  D                   G
But my dreams, they aren't as empty,
      C          D        E
As my conscience seems to be
       Bm           C
I have hours, only lonely
           D                      A
My love is vengeance that's never free
 
 
No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings
Like I do, and I blame you
No one bites back as hard on their anger
None of my pain and woe, can show through
 
CHORUS
 
D            Bm       A        E
When my fist clenches crack it open
         Bm         G       D
Before I use it and lose my cool
       Bm    A            E
When I smile tell me some bad news
         Bm        A          E
Before I laugh and act like a fool
 
And if I swallow anything evil
Stick your finger down my throat
If I shiver please give me a blanket
Keep me warm let me wear your coat
 
No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man
To be the sad man, behind blue eyes
