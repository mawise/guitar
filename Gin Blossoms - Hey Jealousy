[Verse 1]

               D                 E                 F#m             E
Tell me do you think it’d be all right, If I could just crash here tonight
            D                   E                   F#m                  E
You can see I’m in no shape for driving, And anyway I've got no place to go
                D                 E                 F#m           E
And you know it might not be that bad, You were the best I’d ever had
            D                     E            F#m           E
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago, I might not be alone


[Chorus]

                A                 D                 A              D
Tomorrow we can drive around this town, And let the cops chase us around
                     F#m                E                  D
The past is gone but something might be found, To take its place
          D   E           F#m  E
Hey jealousy,   Hey jealousy
          D   E           F#m  E
Hey jealousy,   Hey jealousy


[Verse 2]

            D               E          F#m           E
And you can trust me not to think, And not to sleep around
       D                E                 F#m              E
If you don’t expect too much from me, You might not be let down
                   D                  E            F#m           E
Cause all I really want is to be with you, Feeling like I matter too
            D                     E            F#m                E
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago, I might be here with you


[Chorus]

                A                 D                 A              D
Tomorrow we can drive around this town, And let the cops chase us around
                     F#m                E                  D
The past is gone but something might be found, To take its place
          D
Hey jealousy,

Hey jealousy,   Hey jealousy
          D   E           F#m   E
Hey jealousy,   Hey jealousy

You can see I’m in no shape for driving, And anyway I’ve got no place to go

And you know it might not be that bad, You were the best I’d ever had
            D                     E            F#m           E
If I hadn’t blown the whole thing years ago, I might not be alone


[Out Chorus]

                A                 D                 A              D
Tomorrow we can drive around this town, And let the cops chase us around
                     F#m                E                  D
The past is gone but something might be found, To take its place

Hey jealousy,

[Outro]

          D   E              F#m   E
Hey jealousy,    She took my heart
             D                    E     F#m  E
There's only one thing I couldn't start
