C             Am
Love of mine, someday you will die,
            F                         C            G
but I'll be close behind, I'll follow you into the dark.
   C                          Am
No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white,
               F
just our hands clasped so tight
        C                 G
waiting for the hint of a spark. 

[Chorus:]
     
   Am              C                F             C   
If heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied,
   Am          C             G
illuminate the noes on their vacancy signs.
   Am             C                    E      Am
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
     F           Fm           C
then I'll follow you into the dark.

     
   C                              Am
In Catholic school, as vicious as Roman rule,
         F                     C       G
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black.
      C                     Am
And I held my tongue as she told me "Son, 
            F                     C          G
fear is the heart of love".  So I never went back.

(Chorus)

C                         Am
You and me have seen everything to see
                F                C             G
from Bangkok to Calgary, and the soles of your shoes
    C                           Am
are all worn down. The time for sleep is now
                    F
but it's nothing to cry about  
             C               G      
'cause we'll hold each other soon
       Am          F
in the blackest of rooms.

(Chorus - repeat last line)
