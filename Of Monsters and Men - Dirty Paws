[Verse]

Am                      C
Jumping up and down the floor
   C          Fmaj7
My head is an animal
    Am                    C
And once there was an animal
C                           Fmaj7
It had a son that mowed the lawn
    Am             C
The son was an ok guy
C                    Fmaj7
Thay had a pet dragonfly
    Am                 C
The dragonfly it ran away
C                                Fmaj7
But it came back with a story to say

[Break]

Am, C, Fmaj7
Hey!
Am, C, Fmaj7
Hey!


[Verse]

    Am                   C
Her dirty paws and furry coat
                        Fmaj7
She ran down the forest slope
    Am                  C
The forest of talking trees
                                          Fmaj7
They used to sing about the birds and the bees
    Am                  C
The bees had declared a war
                                   Fmaj7
The sky wasn't big enough for them all
    Am                         C
The birds they got help from below
                                     Fmaj7
From dirty paws and the creatures of snow

[Verse]

    Am                       C
And for a while things were cold
                               Fmaj7
They were scared down in their holes
    Am                   C
The forest that once was green
                                     Fmaj7
Was colored black by those killing machines
    Am                   C
But she and her furry friends
                                Fmaj7
Took down the queen bee and her men
    Am                    C
And that's how the story goes
                                             Fmaj7
The story of the beast with those four dirty paws
