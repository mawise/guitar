BEN E. KING - STAND BY ME
[Intro]

 G   Em   C   D   G

[Verse 1]
         G
When the night has come
Em
  And the land is dark
        C           D                G
And the moon is the only light we'll see
      G
No, I won't be afraid,
      Em
No, I won't be afraid
        C           D               G
Just as long as you stand, stand by me.


[Chorus]
                      G
So, darling, darling, stand by me,
    Em
Oh, stand by me.
    C            D               G
Oh, stand, stand by me, Stand by me.









[Verse 2]
       G
If the sky that we look upon
Em
  Should tumble and fall
       C               D              G
Or the mountain should crumble in the sea,
        G
I won't cry, I won't cry,
      Em
No, I won't shed a tear
        C           D               G
Just as long as you stand, stand by me.


[Chorus]
                      G
So, darling, darling, stand by me,
    Em
Oh, stand by me.
    C            D               G
Oh, stand, stand by me, Stand by me.
