G              C   
Hey, where did we go 
G             D
days when the rain came
G            C
Down in  the hollow
G         D
Playing a new game
G               C
Laughing, and a running, hey, hey
G              D 
Skipping and a jumping 
G            C
In the misty morning fog,
G                 D
with our hearts a thumpin' and 
C    D              G     Em
You,  my brown eyed girl
C    D              G     D
You,  my brown eyed girl

Whatever happened to Tuesday and so slow
Going down to the old mine
With a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and a sliding
All aling the waterfall
With you, my brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl

D7
Do you remember when we used to sing

G         C       G      D7
Sha la la la la la la la te da   Just like that

G         C       G      D7         G
Sha la la la la la la la te da  la te da



So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown
Cast my memory back there Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinkin' 'bout it
Makin love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing

D7   G          C
     Sha la la la la la la la
