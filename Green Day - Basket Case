 G               D        Em          Bm
Do you have the time to listen to me whine

  C                  G               D
About nothing and everything all at once

G             D
I am one of those

   Em          Bm
Melodramatic fools

   C             G
Neurotic to the bone

                  D
No doubt about it
-------------------------
   C         D                G
Sometimes I give myself the creeps

   C         D                    G
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me

    C               D
It all keeps adding up

    G         F      E(m)
I think I'm cracking up

   C           D
Am I just paranoid? 

  (No chords)
I'm just stoned

   G         D
I went to a shrink

     Em        Bm
To analyze my dreams

     C                 G                    D
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me__ down

   G         D
I went to a whore

    Em               Bm
He said my life's a bore

     C                G                    D 
And quit my whining cause it's bringing her__ down
