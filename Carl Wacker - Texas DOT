      D                      E
I was drivin', Route 66 last Tuesday, 
        A                       D 
Headin' west to try to clear my mind,
        F#          G
Figured maybe if, I got myself away,
    D              A         D
The universe would send me a sign.

         D                            E
Should I stay with you and ask you to love me?
         A                               D
Should I keep on drivin' 'till I see the coastline?
         F#                 G
Should I turn back home, or head out to be free?
         D                A             D
Should I keep on rollin', lookin' for a sign?

         G                               D         
  Well I found my answer, posted right before me, 
      E                     A
  Provided by the Texas D O T
                  G                              D
  The signs read "turn around", "wrong way", "no entry"
           E                              A
  Well the message seemed pretty clear to me-

     D                            E
So I took the "exit only" ramp at Bushland, 
       A                               D
At the crossroad I turned to head back east,
               F#                G
The sign said "no U-turn", but I figured that was wrong,
      D              A              D
And I headed back to Tulsa just the same

    G                     D
  I didn't let the DOT confuse me, 
       E                                 A
  With signs that said "detour" or "slow down"
        G                                  D
  That "speed bump" sign was there to just amuse me,
          E                              A
  And the sign that said "no exit" I ran down.

     D                             E
So today I'm back in Tulsa with my sweetheart,
         A                          D
And I've got to thank the Texas D O T
       F#                        G
Their "wrong way" sign showed me we can't be apart
        D                A               D  A  D
Stayin' here with you is where I want to be
